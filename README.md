Instacart Grocery Basket Data and exploratory analysis

Instacart is an online grocery store that wants to target different customer segments with applicable marketing campaigns to increase their sales. The stakeholders are interested in understanding the customer behavior and preferences to come up with a targeted marketing strategy. They have several key questions related to the busiest days and hours of the week, the highest spending times, popular products, price range groupings, customer segmentation based on brand loyalty, ordering habits based on loyalty status, region, age, family status, and other demographics. The objective of the project is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of Instacart's data to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation.
